# The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.
#
#  1  => I
# 10  => X
#  7  => VII
#
# There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)
#
# Modern Roman numerals are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any 
# digit with a value of zero.
#
# In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:
#
#   1000 = M
#    900 = CM
#     90 = XC
#
# 2008 is written as MMVIII:
# 
#   2000 = MM
#      8 = VIII
#
# Write a program that converts a given number to Roman numerals.
